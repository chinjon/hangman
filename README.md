# Information

The theme of the game is based on rapper MF DOOM who is know for this usage of uncanny words and ability to deliver verbose bars.

## Functionality



## Tools Used  

Used Parallax.JS to create the header along with an overlay for the text. For sound, Howler.JS was implemented and tracks coincide with the words in the word bank.

## Problems  

Upon load, the translucent overlay will load and fill based on how far down the page is scrolled. The plugin will not resize the overlay as the page gets larger in height (ie. when elements are added with JQuery).
